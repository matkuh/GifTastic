### I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, JQuery, and Giphy's API to build a gif search and display site.  There are 5 premade buttons that you can click on to generate 10 gifs in that category.  There is also the option to add your own button that will display gifs on click.  The gifs will start out in a "still" state, and will animate on click.
